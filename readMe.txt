A legit UTF8 - Unicode aware Textbox for openFrameworks (mac & pc)

This textbox - unlike all other OF textboxes- derives directly from microsoft and apples official classes and is attached above open gl. - and not rendered by it.


All languages are supported. If your os supports the language then ofTextField supports it as well.

get the text as a UTF8 string and draw it in your OF app using fontstash or other unicode aware text rendering classes

legit copy paste menus by apple and microsoft.

spelling check and more!


How to use:


Just replace ofSystemUtils.cpp & ofSystemUtils.h inside  libs/openFrameworks/utils/


An example is included

All Feedback is welcomed!
